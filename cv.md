I want to learn how to code and be able to make a website

I got no experience, but i read some info about Javascrypt; I am also curious about Typescrypt and wish to learn it too

One of the tasks on codewars, a site where i learned a bit about Javascript, my nickname there: Setir5

The name of this task is: Training JS #7: if..else and ternary operator

function saleHotdogs(n){
  if (n<5) {
    return n * 100;
  }
  else if (n>=5 && n<10) {
    return n*95;
  }
  else {
    return n*90;
}
}

i also got no experience working in serious envirement


RSscool - is the first serious coding course that i decided to try


English levels - c1, although sometimes got problems with grammar
